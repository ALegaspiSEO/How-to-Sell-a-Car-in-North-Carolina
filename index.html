            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Selling Your Car</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Prepare Your Vehicle for Sale</h3>
                <p>First impressions matter when selling a car. A clean, well-maintained vehicle is more likely to attract buyers and fetch a higher price. Start by thoroughly cleaning the car's interior and exterior, removing personal items, and addressing any odors or stains. Vacuum the seats, wipe down surfaces, and polish the windows to make the car shine.</p>
                <p>Gather maintenance records, such as oil changes, tire rotations, or brake repairs, to demonstrate the car’s upkeep. If you have recent inspection reports, include them to build buyer trust. Consider making minor repairs, such as replacing burned-out bulbs, worn wipers, or addressing small dents and scratches, as these can significantly boost the car’s appeal. If the tires or brakes are worn, replacing them may increase the car’s value.</p>
                <p>High-quality photos are essential for online listings. Take clear, well-lit pictures from multiple angles, including the dashboard, odometer, and any unique features like a sunroof or backup camera. Write a transparent description that includes the year, make, model, mileage, condition, special features, and any known issues. Honesty in your listing builds trust and sets realistic expectations for buyers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Understand North Carolina’s Legal Requirements</h3>
                <p>North Carolina has specific regulations for selling a car to ensure a legal transfer of ownership. Failing to follow these can result in delays or legal liabilities. You’ll need the following documents:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Title:</strong> The title must be in your name, with any liens released.</li>
                    <li><strong>Odometer Disclosure Statement:</strong> Required for vehicles less than 10 years old to report accurate mileage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Damage Disclosure Statement:</strong> Disclose any past wrecks or repairs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bill of Sale:</strong> While not mandatory, it’s recommended to document the sale price, date, and terms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power of Attorney Form:</strong> Needed only if someone else handles the sale on your behalf.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key rules to know: The buyer is responsible for paying sales tax. You can sell a car with an expired registration, but the buyer cannot drive it until it’s registered. For out-of-state buyers, follow North Carolina’s title transfer rules, as the buyer will handle registration in their state. Always verify requirements with the <a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv" target="_blank">North Carolina DMV</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Set a Competitive Price and Find Buyers</h3>
                <p>Pricing your car correctly is crucial for attracting buyers. Use online tools like Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, or NADA Guides to estimate your car’s market value based on its make, model, mileage, and condition. Be honest about the car’s condition to set a fair price and leave room for negotiation, as buyers often expect to haggle.</p>
                <p>Decide how to sell your car:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Private Sale:</strong> Offers the potential for a higher price but requires more effort, such as creating listings and meeting buyers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dealership:</strong> Quick and convenient, but you may receive a lower offer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online Marketplaces:</strong> Platforms like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace reach a broad audience but require quality photos and a compelling description.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you’ve set a price and chosen a selling method, create a listing that highlights your car’s best features and be prepared to negotiate with potential buyers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Complete the Paperwork</h3>
                <p>Properly transferring ownership is critical to avoid future liability. To sign the title in North Carolina, fill in the buyer’s name, address, mileage, and date, then sign and print both your name and the buyer’s. Double-check for accuracy.</p>
                <p>Remove the license plate, as North Carolina requires sellers to keep or transfer it to another vehicle. File a Notice of Sale with the DMV to officially document the ownership change and protect yourself from liability. Keep copies of all documents, including the signed title, bill of sale, and any DMV forms, for your records.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Finalize the Sale</h3>
                <p>Accept payment securely using a certified check or bank transfer. Cash is acceptable for in-person transactions, but avoid personal checks to minimize risk. For test drives, verify the buyer’s driver’s license and insurance, and consider riding along to ensure safety.</p>
                <p>After the sale, cancel your insurance, remove your registration, and return or transfer the license plate. Retain all sales records for future reference. If selling to an out-of-state buyer, prioritize completing the title transfer and include a bill of sale.
